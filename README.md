# Cex

**Important: this is currently just a learning project yet. I don't know if it
will be maintained for long.**

Crypto Exchange (cex) provides a unified interface to the APIs of different
crypto currency exchanges.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `cex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:
